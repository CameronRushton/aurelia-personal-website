              Hey! I'm a computer software developer born in 1997, raised in Whitby, Ontario and live in Ottawa, Ontario.
              I've been interested in computing for a while. I never knew any programmers or dedicated computer nerds growing up,
              so I had to carve my own path. I taught myself to read and write in binary and hexadecimal when I was 13 because I thought it was neat.
              In grade 10, my highschool offered a programming course where we learned the basics with the turing language.
              The next two years offered an additional course that involved tinkering with breadboards, arduinos, robots and soldering as
              well as moving us to use java instead. Even though I started with self motivation, I wouldn't be here without the people that helped along the way.
              I love crafting new programs, adding new features and learning about other industries the software helps.
              I firmly believe I can do anything if I tried hard enough and I recognise how lucky I am to be able to choose the career
              that I love, am good at and society needs.
